# **Image Captioning with Flickr8k Dataset**

## Overview

This project focuses on **Image Captioning**, where an AI model generates descriptive and contextually relevant captions for images. Trained on the **Flickr8k dataset**, the model transforms images into insightful narratives, making visual content more accessible and engaging. The goal of this project is to showcase how deep learning can be leveraged to bridge the gap between vision and language.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: Trained on the **Flickr8k dataset**, which contains 8,000 images with 5 captions each.
- **Model**: The model is designed to generate captions that are contextually accurate and descriptive, ensuring high relevance to the content of the image.
- **Application**: The project can be used in a wide range of applications, including content creation, social media, accessibility tools, and more.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Caption Generation**: Simply upload an image, and the model generates a detailed and accurate caption for it.
- **Contextually Relevant Descriptions**: The model captures the essence of each image and provides captions that make sense in the given context.
- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome to improve and expand its capabilities.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
Install dependencies:

The project requires several Python libraries for training and generating captions. You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Flickr8k dataset:

You can download the Flickr8k dataset from here. After downloading, place the dataset in the data/ folder of the repository.

Usage
Generate captions for an image:

After setting up the project, you can generate captions for any image in your local directory. Run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python generate_caption.py --image_path path_to_image.jpg
The model will output a caption that describes the content of the image.

Model Training
If you wish to train the model on your own dataset or retrain it with different parameters, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset and ensure it is in the correct format (images and captions).

Modify the configuration files in config/ as needed.

Train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
You can adjust the training parameters based on your hardware capabilities.
