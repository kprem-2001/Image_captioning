# **Image Captioning with Flickr8k Dataset**

## Overview

This project demonstrates **Image Captioning** where an AI model generates descriptive and contextually relevant captions for images. Trained on the **Flickr8k dataset**, this model converts visual content into insightful narratives. The goal is to showcase how deep learning techniques can bridge the gap between vision and language.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: Trained on the **Flickr8k dataset**, which contains 8,000 images with 5 captions each.
- **Model**: A deep learning-based image captioning model that generates accurate and relevant captions for images.
- **Application**: This project can be used in multiple domains like content creation, social media, accessibility tools, and more.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Caption Generation**: Upload any image, and the model will generate a detailed and accurate caption.
- **Contextually Relevant Descriptions**: The model ensures the generated captions are highly relevant and meaningful in the given context.
- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, and contributions are welcome to enhance and refine its capabilities.

# Usage üöÄ
To use this project, you can either run it as a command-line tool or as a web interface.

### Command-line tool üíª
To run the project as a command-line tool, you can use the following command:

```bash
python caption.py --image <path_to_image>
```
This will generate a caption for the image and print it to the standard output.

### Web interface üåê
To run the project as a web interface, you can use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will launch a Flask server and open a web page in your browser. You can then upload an image and see the generated caption.
